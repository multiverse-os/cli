# TOML Config 
Very basic code for loading configuration from TOML. This is something 
so consistently used in most of our software that it just makes sense
to have this be an optional component of our CLI framework. 

To remain lightweight, it is not loaded or used by default, it does
not add any additional weight to the framework because it is 
completely optional.

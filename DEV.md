# Development Journal

It is now, or near, the initial release candidate. The ANSI library needs to be
completed. 

And it would be very nice to have some built-ins for data output; like tables,
bullet lists (using symbol library). 

Before any real release the input side needs to be completed. There needs to be
a standard way to allow users to input data, like selections from a list,
validations and so on. This will be required to use this to make the Multiverse
OS CLI installer

# Simple Logger
A very simple, optional and easy to override logger to work with the CLI
framework. It provides a simple interface to just write to screen with
function call as simple as `log.Info("info text")` or a more complex
`logger` that supports writing to a specified file. And the interface
is very simple and easy to override if a more complex logging system
is desired.

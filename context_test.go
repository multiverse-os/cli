// TODO: Want to focus on building tests around the parsing functionality since
// this is a core aspect fo the software and this is where testing is not only
// most needed but most useful.
// Later we can build testing around output/logging, command tree
// selection/splitting, recursive flag lookup, and action handling. We will not
// be testing every function, we will be testing the functions that tests could
// be useful.

// TODO: Setup an example application, we can base it on the example code.
